            <h2>NFTs are not Decentralized</h2>
            <p>One of the fundamental flaws of blockchain technology in relation to NFTs is that though the link to the
                NFT is decentralized, the link goes to a centralized website. Many NFTs are hosted in a website's
                metadata or Amazon Web Services, but some are hosted even in Dropbox Google Drives. This means if the
                website goes down, you no longer have access to your NFT. The NFTs that are in Dropbox or Google Drive
                can be altered to have another image as well. The workaround this is to put your NFT in a secure,
                external hard drive, but this brings makes the NFT no different from a physical painting.
            </p>
            <p>Until decentralized websites are used to store these NFTs, NFTs will never be truly unique. </p><br>

            </figure><br>
            <h2>NFTs are filled with Scams and Hacks</h2>
            <p>Though the blockchain itself is rarely hacked, each block's smart contract connects the access to the NFT
                to a crypto wallet, and crypto wallets can be hacked. When crypto discord channels are lenient with
                their security, webhooks can be used to bypass security, which leads to hackers transferring expensive
                NFTs to other wallets with no way to get them back.
            </p>
            <p>Scams are also prevalent in the NFT space through the form of rug pulls or pump and dump schemes. Rug
                pulls are when investors of the NFT send funds to the NFT developers, and once the developers receive
                the money, they can shut down the project and run away with the funds. Pump and dump schemes are when
                the price of an NFT is inflated causing artificial scarcity, and once the price increases, they sell
                their NFTs and run.
            </p>
            <p>The hacks and the NFT scams that are in the community should be shunned more by the overarching community
                so that the government does not need to step into maintaining the cryptocurrency space. If the
                government were to regulate cryptocurrency, then there would be centralization- and what would be the
                point of having another centralized system?

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Some of these decisions may be hard to do as this may deter investors, and therefore cause people in the
                space to lose money. However, if these people truly believe that blockchain technology can be the
                future, these risks must be taken to improve the technology. Ethereum was able to move from
                proof-of-work to proof-of-stake for the sake of being more environmentally friendly, which was a big
                issue. Moving to proof-of-stake went against the fundamental value of decentralization, but this would
                improve the technology in the long run. Many more of these decisions must be made if NFTs are ever going
                to be beneficial to artists.
