            <h2>What is cryptocurrency?</h2>
            <p>Regular currencies are physical and the decision-making is given to one group. Cryptocurrencies on the
                other hand, are digital currencies with ledgers that are stored in many computers, making them
                decentralized. Decentralization is favorable because this makes the currency more secure, trustworthy,
                and likelier to survive. There&#39;s a fixed supply of these currencies, there can&#39;t be huge amounts
                of
                inflation, and the profits from investing can help people get quick cash. So, many believe that
                cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are the future.

            <h2>How is crypto transferred?</h2>
            <p>So, let's say someone wants to transfer cryptocurrency to another person. The transfer is represented
                online as a “block”, and the block is checked online by many others to approve and validate the
                transaction. Then the block is added to a chain of transactions, and then the money is moved. When
                someone checks a section of these blocks, they are rewarded with some of the currency. More of the
                currency is made, the currency becomes more secure, and the blockchain can be used for unique digital
                assets.

            <h2>And finally, what are NFTs?</h2>
            <p>NFTs are digital assets that are “stored” in this digital ledger, and each asset will have its own unique
                identifier. As the block that holds the NFT is secure, the data that is stored in the NFT is also
                secure, therefore creating a unique digital token. When multiple copies of the same NFT are made, each
                However, it must be noted that the actual NFT is not on the blockchain- it is usually a link to the
                image, put in a smart contract to give a specific crypto wallet ownership.
