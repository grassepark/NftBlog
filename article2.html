            <h2>What is blockchain technology being used for?</h2>
            <p>NFTs are often used as tokenizing artwork or real life objects, but it can also be used as passes for web
                experiences or games. Games like CryptoKitties, Axie Infinity, or Cinder require NFTs to be bought
                before entering these experiences, giving a sense of exclusivity.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>However, NFTs are usually used for creating PNGs with smart contracts, often randomizing accessories and
                colors to create a collection. These smart contracts deem these images as one of a kind.</p><br>
            <h2>How profitable are they?</h2>
            <p>Many found out about NFTs in 2020-2021, when Beeple sold his artwork as NFTs for millions of dollars. The
                auction house, Christie&rsquo;s, was known for selling many fine art paintings, and to
                put&nbsp;Everydays: The First 5000 Days&nbsp;next to these paintings signaled artists that NFTs could be
                a way for digital artists to get more money. </p><br>

                <figcaption>Beeple's NFT</figcaption>
            </figure><br>
            <p>But did you know that the person who bought Beeple&rsquo;s
                69 million NFT&hellip; bought the NFT to boost the reputation of cryptocurrency to benefit his own
                cryptocurrency scheme? Celebrities advertise their NFT purchases because they either have investments in
                cryptocurrency or were just paid to do so; they didn&rsquo;t do it because they&rsquo;re passionate
                about a better future.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Anyway, the primary reason why many artists are making NFTs right now is the amount of money you could
                make. Artists can receive royalties from NFTs, as when an NFT is sold multiple times, the smart contract
                often include automatic royalties. However, this&nbsp;<a
                    href="https://thatkimparker.medium.com/most-artists-are-not-making-money-off-nfts-and-here-are-some-graphs-to-prove-it-c65718d4a1b8">source</a>
                from 2021 shows statistics based off of one of the primary NFT selling websites.&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>33.6% of Primary Sales were $100 or less</li>
                <li>20.0% of Primary Sales were $100-$200</li>
                <li>11.1% of Primary Sales were $200-$300</li>
                <li>7.7% of Primary Sales were $300-$400</li>
                <li>3.9% of Primary Sales were $400&ndash;500</li>
                <li>3.3% of Primary Sales were $500-$600</li>
                <li>2.5% of Primary Sales were $600&ndash;$700</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most NFT sites will recommend you set your sale price at 0.5 ETH, which was about $894 USD on March 19th.
                The number of Primary Sales that ended up selling for the recommended price was 1.8%.</p>
            <p>This seems okay, until you count in the gas fee (creating the NFT), the listing fee(putting up the NFT),
                and the claim fee (turning the cryptocurrency to real money). If you&rsquo;re part of the 33.6% of the
                community that makes $100 in Ethereum, it is estimated that 72.5% &mdash; 157.5% of your sale will be
                deducted. If you are able to sell them for a little more, like 300$, 40% will still be taken off.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>However, Ethereum has recently moved to proof of stake, a more efficient and environmentally friendly way
                of validating blockchain technology. This theoretically should reduce the gas fees, but as of 2022,
                there is no change.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This isn&rsquo;t accounting for the fluctuating price of the cryptocurrency itself. On Sept 7, 2021, the
                price of all cryptocurrencies dropped 15% in less than 24 hours. Another crash happened on January 23,
                2022; specifically Etherium fell 13.5% in less than 24 hours, which is down 24% this year! These kinds
                of changes can happen in the middle of transactions too, and the money that you are promised can be
                cut.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In essence, the only people who are getting a huge income out of NFTs are established artists or
                celebrities. As of 2022, you are not able to do this as a &ldquo;side hustle&rdquo; because of the
                risks, and the possibility of getting a profit is not worth the issues that have been covered.</p>
